### The basic idea of time stretching by time-segment processing is to divide the input sound into segments.
Then if the sound is to be lengthened, some segments are repeated, while if the sound is to be shortened,
some segments are discarded. A possible problem is amplitude and phase discontinuity at the boundaries of the
segments. Amplitude discontinuities are avoided by partially overlapping the blocks, while phase
discontinuities are avoided by a proper time alignment of the blocks. Two different strategies will
be presented in Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3.
