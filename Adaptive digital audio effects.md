    Pitch extraction
    <p>The main task of pitch extraction is to estimate a fundamental frequency f0, which in musical terms
is the pitch of a sound segment, and follow the fundamental frequency over the time. We can use
this pitch information to control effects like time stretching and pitch shifting based on the PSOLA
method, which is described in Chapter 6, but it also plays a major role in sound modeling with
spectral models, which is treated extensively in Chapter 10. Moreover, the fundamental frequency
can be used as a control parameter for a variety of audio effects based either on time-domain or
on frequency-domain processing </p>
