For inharmonic sounds, pitch-shifting by frequency warping is more accurate than conventional 
algorithms based on proportional scaling of fundamental frequency and overtones.

by frequency warping the original piano tone with the inverse of the
fitted Laguerre map, one transforms the originally inharmonic partials into a set of harmonic
partials
